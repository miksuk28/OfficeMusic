Extremely basic music player that I run on a raspberry pi at my office.

It's just a loop that updates the git repo (containing the playlist) and then feeds said playlist (which is just a list of YouTube URLs) into mpv.

Why use a proper music player like mpd when you can just cram YouTube URLs into mpv

# Install

1. Get a raspberry pi
2. Bring it to work
3. Find some old speakers to plug into it
4. Install mpv and updated youtube-dl on pi
5. Clone this repo
6. Run mpv with my playlist I guess
7. Maybe use the service file so it starts being noisy on boot fuck if i know
8. Go fill your coffee mug and get back to work i'm not paying you to mess around with a raspberry pi and some speakers
